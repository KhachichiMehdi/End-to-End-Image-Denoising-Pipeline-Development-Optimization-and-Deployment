# **Image Denoising in Agriculture with MLOps Pipelines**

## **Introduction**

In agriculture, images captured by drones, satellites, or field cameras are invaluable for applications like:
- Crop monitoring
- Disease detection
- Yield prediction
- Precision farming

However, these images often contain noise due to environmental factors such as:
- Poor lighting
- Motion blur
- Sensor limitations

This noise can negatively impact the accuracy of downstream analytics and decision-making processes in agricultural systems.

## **Purpose of the Project**

This project is part of my **training for an internship** as a Machine Learning Engineer. It is designed to help me gain hands-on experience in developing robust machine learning models and scalable MLOps pipelines. 

As I am not permitted to share the specifics of my work during the internship, this project represents a **training exercise** inspired by real-world challenges. It demonstrates the ability to:
1. Design and implement a **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)** for image denoising.
2. Build an end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** for model deployment and scalability.

## **Project Objectives**

### **Core Objectives**
- Design and train a **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)** to effectively denoise agricultural images.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like **MSE**
- Optimization : find the optimal model 

### **MLOps Practices**
1. **Versioning**: 
   - Version models, and code for traceability and reproducibility.
2. **Experiment Tracking**: 
   - Use **MLflow** to log experiments, hyperparameters, and metrics.
3. **API Development**: 
   - Develop a RESTful API for real-time image denoising.
4. **Scalability**: 
   - Deploy the model using containerization (**Docker**).
5. **Modularity and Maintainability**:
   - Structure the pipeline into modular components for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment.
6. **Logging** :
   - Monitor the flow of the program.
   - Capture key events, warnings, and errors.
   - Debug efficiently without relying on print statements.
   - Persist logs to files for long-term analysis.

## **Pipeline Overview**

1. **Data Ingestion and  Preparation**:
   - Load, clean, and preprocess noisy and clean image datasets.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train the Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) on paired noisy-clean images.
   - Automate hyperparameter tuning and logging using **MLflow**.

3. ** Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using MSE and save it on a json format.
   - Visualize sample results.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Package the model into a containerized application using **Docker**.
   - Deploy the API and model to production using *GCP* for scalability.


## **Configuration and Utilities**

### **1. Configuration (`configuration.py`)**
This module defines and manages all the configurable parameters for the project, such as:
- Paths for logs, datasets, and models.
- Model hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
- Default settings for preprocessing (e.g., image size).

### **2. Common Utilities (`utils/common.py`)**
This module provides reusable functions for repetitive tasks. Key features include:
- Functions to save and load models.
- General-purpose helper methods.

### **3. Configuration Entities (`entity/config_entity.py`)**
This module defines data structures (entities) to encapsulate configurations logically. These entities:
- Improve code readability and maintainability.
- Allow configurations to be passed as structured objects.
- Example: `ModelConfig` for model settings or `TrainingConfig` for training parameters.

### **How They Work Together**
- **`configuration.py`**: Defines global settings.
- **`utils/common.py`**: Uses settings from `configuration.py` to perform tasks.
- **`entity/config_entity.py`**: Combines settings into structured entities for modularity.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras for model development.
- **MLOps Tools**:
  - **MLflow**: Experiment tracking and model versioning.
  - **Docker**: Containerization for portability.
  - **GCP**: Cloud deployments.
- **APIs**: FastAPI for serving the model.
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, OpenCV for image preprocessing.

## **Future Work**
- Integrate **automated retraining** pipelines based on new agricultural datasets.
- Extend the system to handle additional noise types and image resolutions.
- **Monitoring**: Log predictions and performance metrics in real time and set up alerts for model drift or degraded performance.
- Explore advanced architectures, such as GANs, for denoising.

## **Conclusion**

This project is a **training exercise** aimed at developing my skills in building and deploying machine learning pipelines. It reflects my understanding of **MLOps best practices** and my ability to solve real-world challenges in the domain of agricultural image processing.

As this project is independent of my internship work, it does not disclose any proprietary or confidential information.
